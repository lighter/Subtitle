Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.65,0:04:40.87,yin,,0,0,0,,一个是我们说的国际化\N{\fs12}There's something we called "internationalization" --

Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.50,0:05:04.46,yin,,0,0,0,,将应用程序翻译为另一种语言\N{\fs12}your application -- to another language.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.46,0:05:05.83,yin,,0,0,0,,这是一个两步的过程\N{\fs12}So it's really a two-step process.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.71,0:05:40.36,yin,,0,0,0,,我们只需要改变故事板中出现的字符串\N{\fs12}is we only change the strings that appear in the storyboard,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.36,0:05:45.43,yin,,0,0,0,,然后我们再让自动布局来匹配字符串的变宽和变窄\N{\fs12}and we let Auto Layout resize things to fit wider and shorter strings.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.43,0:05:48.93,yin,,0,0,0,,这是自动布局很方便的一点\N{\fs12}That's a great side benefit of having Auto Layout,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.93,0:05:52.91,yin,,0,0,0,,这样本地化就只关系到故事板的字符串了\N{\fs12}is that localization now is just about the strings when it comes to the storyboard.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.91,0:05:53.93,yin,,0,0,0,,不过首先\N{\fs12}But the first thing we need
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.93,0:05:57.84,yin,,0,0,0,,在进行任何本地化之前\N{\fs12}to do before we do any localization is to go

Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.25,0:18:14.86,yin,,0,0,0,,我打算讲两个很简单的例子\N{\fs12}But I'm going to look at two pretty simple cases.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:14.86,0:18:18.25,yin,,0,0,0,,一个是显示数字 另一个是读取数字\N{\fs12}One is displaying numbers and one is reading numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:18.25,0:18:22.70,yin,,0,0,0,,对于在屏幕上显示数字 你可能希望\N{\fs12}So for displaying number on screen you're probably want
Dialogue: 0,0:18:22.70,0:18:25.21,yin,,0,0,0,,使用stringWithFormat %g\N{\fs12}to do string with format percent G.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:25.21,0:18:28.65,yin,,0,0,0,,%g是说通用浮点数\N{\fs12}"Percent G" just means generic floating point number.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.65,0:18:30.61,yin,,0,0,0,,但这里不要这样\N{\fs12}But you don't want to do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.61,0:18:34.01,yin,,0,0,0,,你需要使用NSNumberFormatter中的这个方法\N{\fs12}What you want to do is use this method in NS number formatter
Dialogue: 0,0:18:34.01,0:18:36.88,yin,,0,0,0,,名为localizedStringFromNumber numberStyle\N{\fs12}called localized string from number, number style.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:36.88,0:18:40.21,yin,,0,0,0,,数字样式有很多 例如小数 还有拼出\N{\fs12}Okay. And there's different number styles like decimal and spell out.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:40.21,0:18:43.89,yin,,0,0,0,,拼出是说 例如4 我们要拼成four\N{\fs12}We'll even spell it out. Like, if you put a four in there, it will say four, f-o-u-r.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.89,0:18:45.03,yin,,0,0,0,,这是拼出\N{\fs12}Okay, spell it out.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.03,0:18:47.36,yin,,0,0,0,,这里有不同的格式\N{\fs12}So there's different formats for doing that.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:47.38,0:18:50.15,yin,,0,0,0,,这会返回一个可以放到UI中的字符串\N{\fs12}And that will give you back a string that you can put in the UI
Dialogue: 0,0:18:50.15,0:18:54.10,yin,,0,0,0,,显示数字的方式将适用于你所处的locale\N{\fs12}that will display the number in a way that's appropriate for the locale you're in.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.10,0:18:57.08,yin,,0,0,0,,对于大数字 例如1000\N{\fs12}And especially, again, a large number like a thousand
Dialogue: 0,0:18:57.08,0:19:01.21,yin,,0,0,0,,美国会写成1,000.00\N{\fs12}in the US might be one comma zero zero zero point zero zero;
Dialogue: 0,0:19:01.21,0:19:05.41,yin,,0,0,0,,而英国会写成1.000,00\N{\fs12}whereas in Great Britain it would be one period zero zero zero comma zero zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:05.41,0:19:07.62,yin,,0,0,0,,这样做就能弄对那些\N{\fs12}Okay. And so this would get that right.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:07.62,0:19:10.12,yin,,0,0,0,,然后有解析数字 读取数字\N{\fs12}Then there's parsing numbers, reading them.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:10.12,0:19:14.79,yin,,0,0,0,,这里你可能想说int value\N{\fs12}You really probably want here to just say int value
Dialogue: 0,0:19:14.79,0:19:16.84,yin,,0,0,0,,或是字符串的float value\N{\fs12}or float value of a string,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:16.84,0:19:21.57,yin,,0,0,0,,这会将浮点数或是整型数解释为输入\N{\fs12}which will parse it and try it interpret a float or an int as the input.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:21.57,0:19:23.09,yin,,0,0,0,,但这并不是正确的做法\N{\fs12}But that's not really the right way to do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:23.09,0:19:24.84,yin,,0,0,0,,你应该使用NumberFormatter\N{\fs12}You should use the number formatter here.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.84,0:19:26.29,yin,,0,0,0,,你创建一个formatter\N{\fs12}So you just create a formatter,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.29,0:19:28.62,yin,,0,0,0,,设置你要读取数字的样式\N{\fs12}set the style of number that you're trying to read in --
Dialogue: 0,0:19:28.62,0:19:30.37,yin,,0,0,0,,同上面一样\N{\fs12}same thing as we saw above there --
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.37,0:19:32.94,yin,,0,0,0,,然后你将得到解析后的数字 作为NSNumber\N{\fs12}and then you're going to get the parsed number as in NS number
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.94,0:19:35.17,yin,,0,0,0,,通过调用numberFromString\N{\fs12}by calling number from string.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.17,0:19:37.23,yin,,0,0,0,,这会去看那个字符串\N{\fs12}And that's going to look in that string,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:37.23,0:19:41.68,yin,,0,0,0,,然后把它解析为货币或是小数\N{\fs12}parse it like a currency or just a decimal number.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:41.68,0:19:45.51,yin,,0,0,0,,如果用户键入1.000,00\N{\fs12}And so if the person types in one period zero zero zero comma zero zero,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:45.51,0:19:48.91,yin,,0,0,0,,而他处在英国locale 你就会得到1000\N{\fs12}you'll get a thousand if they're in the Great Britain locale.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:48.91,0:19:49.93,yin,,0,0,0,,理解吗\N{\fs12}Make sense?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:49.93,0:19:51.52,yin,,0,0,0,,而在美国 你就无法得到\N{\fs12}Whereas in the US you wouldn't get that.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:51.52,0:19:55.57,yin,,0,0,0,,1.000可能让你得到1 甚至nil\N{\fs12}One period zero zero zero probably will give you one or might even give you nil
Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.57,0:19:58.78,yin,,0,0,0,,因为这甚至不是合法的数字\N{\fs12}because that's not really even a number.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:00.03,0:20:04.35,yin,,0,0,0,,日期 这个也很复杂 你需要小心\N{\fs12}Dates -- another complicated one you have to be careful of.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.35,0:20:07.01,yin,,0,0,0,,关于日期 我只想说\N{\fs12}All I'm going to say about dates is
Dialogue: 0,0:20:07.01,0:20:10.27,yin,,0,0,0,,记住我们所使用的公历\N{\fs12}familiarize yourself with the concept that our calendar,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.27,0:20:13.52,yin,,0,0,0,,并不是世界上唯一的历法\N{\fs12}the Gregorian calendar, is not the only calendar in the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:13.52,0:20:15.67,yin,,0,0,0,,历法还有别的\N{\fs12}There are other calendars out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.67,0:20:19.62,yin,,0,0,0,,iOS中有处理所有这些的机制\N{\fs12}And there's mechanism in iOS for dealing with all of them,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:19.62,0:20:22.75,yin,,0,0,0,,不过你需要知道怎么做 我显然没时间一一讲到\N{\fs12}but you have to know how to do it. I can't cover it all in one lecture --

Dialogue: 0,1:05:44.04,1:05:49.33,yin,,0,0,0,,我们希望有一种方式能在Bouncer中设置弹性\N{\fs12}So we would want to have some way here in Bouncer to be able to set the elasticity
Dialogue: 0,1:05:49.33,1:05:52.53,yin,,0,0,0,,可能是某个手势 我们没有使用捏手势\N{\fs12}maybe a gesture, maybe, you know, we're not using pinching.

Dialogue: 0,1:06:24.96,1:06:28.59,yin,,0,0,0,,问题是 如果我有办法在app中设置弹性\N{\fs12}Yeah, so the question is: If I did have a way to set elasticity in my app,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:28.59,1:06:31.77,yin,,0,0,0,,我是否就肯定不应该再在设置app中设置了\N{\fs12}should I definitely not set them in my settings?

Dialogue: 0,1:06:38.55,1:06:41.41,yin,,0,0,0,,你点新游戏 然后它就会问你 你想要多大的弹性\N{\fs12}Like, you say new game and it says, "What elasticity do you want?"
Dialogue: 0,1:06:41.41,1:06:42.53,yin,,0,0,0,,这时你仍然\N{\fs12}It's possible you might want
Dialogue: 0,1:06:42.53,1:06:45.79,yin,,0,0,0,,可以在设置app中去设置默认弹性\N{\fs12}to have setting apps set the default elasticity, right,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:45.79,1:06:49.72,yin,,0,0,0,,这时程序问多大弹性时 会从这个默认值开始\N{\fs12}so that when it asks you about the elasticity, it starts with that default.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:49.72,1:06:51.57,yin,,0,0,0,,你可能会需要这样做\N{\fs12}So it's possible you might want to have that.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:51.57,1:06:53.83,yin,,0,0,0,,不过一般而言 不要把用户搞糊涂了\N{\fs12}But generally you don't want the user confused about,

Dialogue: 0,1:06:57.06,1:07:01.19,yin,,0,0,0,,这时 在设置app中 你可能需要写默认弹性\N{\fs12}So even in that case in settings you'd probably want to call it default elasticity,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:01.19,1:07:04.82,yin,,0,0,0,,而这里 你需要写成弹性\N{\fs12}and then here you would call it elasticity or something like that.
